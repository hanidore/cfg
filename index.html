            <h2>What is Gender-based Violence (GBV)?</h2>
            <p>According to the UNWOMEN definition, “Gender-based violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at
                an
                individual or a group of individuals based on their gender. It is rooted in gender inequality, the
                abuse
                of
                power and harmful norms.” The term is used to highlight the fact that women and girls are at risk of
                many
                forms of violence because of gender-based power differences. The term is also sometimes used to
                describe
                targeted violence against LGBTQI+ populations when referencing violence related to norms of
                masculinity/femininity and/or gender norms.</p>

            <h3>Types of Gender-based Violence</h3>
            <h4>GBV violence comes in many forms, however, they are all gendered in their nature.</h4>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <b>
                        <li>Violence against women and girls (VAWG)</li>
                    </b>
                    Women and girls are the most affected population of GBV

                    <b>
                        <li>Violence against LGBTI people</li>
                    </b>
                    GBV is often experienced by people who are seen as not conforming to their assigned gender
                    roles,
                    such
                    as
                    lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex people.

                    <b>
                        <li>Intimate partner violence (IPV)</li>
                    </b>
                    IPV is the most common type of GBV and includes physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and
                    controlling
                    behaviours by a current or former intimate partner or spouse.

                    <b>
                        <li>Domestic violence (DV)</li>
                    </b>
                    Domestic violence refers to violence which is carried out by partners or family members. This
                    means
                    that
                    DV
                    can include IPV. However, it also encompasses violence against children or other family members.

                    <b>
                        <li>Sexual violence (SV)</li>
                    </b>
                    Sexual violence is “any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or
                    advances, or
                    acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any
                    person
                    regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to
                    home
                    and
                    work.”

                    <b>
                        <li>Indirect (structural) violence</li>
                    </b>
                    Structural violence is “where violence is built into structures, appearing as unequal power
                    relations
                    and,
                    consequently, as unequal opportunities. Structural violence exists when certain groups, classes,
                    genders
                    or
                    nationalities have privileged access to goods, resources and opportunities over others, and when
                    this
                    unequal advantage is built into the social, political and economic systems that govern their
                    lives.”
                    Simply
                    put, Structural violence are social forces that harm certain groups of people, producing and
                    perpetuating
                    inequality in health and well-being. It includes social, economic, and political processes that
                    manifest
                    in
                    both material and symbolic means of social exclusion.
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Why it is Important?</h3>
            <p>Gender Base violence is a serious worldwide problem that has been described by the United Nations
                Children
                Emergency Fund (UNICEF) as “the most pervasive yet least visible human rights violation in the
                world.”
                It is
                a social issue that cuts across all people of all groups and one that is prevalent at all levels of
                social
                and economic standing in human society. Effectively, we cannot end extreme poverty or achieve the
                United
                Nations' Global Goals if GBV remains such a prominent challenge.</p>

                <h3>Modupe, Nigeria</h3>
                <p>Modupe experienced image-based abuse, when an intimate photo of her was shared without her
                    consent.
                    <br><br>
                    "I was 16 when I started accessing the internet. I had a friend who introduced me to
                    Facebook
                    and
                    helped
                    me create an account. As soon as I logged on I began receiving requests. <br><br>
                    I didn't know the first person who contacted me, but we became very close. We were in
                    contact
                    for
                    around
                    three months and would communicate every day. He would ask personal questions and I'd answer
                    — I
                    thought
                    it was a way for us to get to know each other. Eventually, he wanted to see a picture and
                    asked
                    me
                    to
                    send something so I gave him one of me wearing clothes. He said I should take the pictures
                    without
                    wearing anything, it would be better that way. I was lured into believing what we were doing
                    was
                    right
                    and it was just with this one person who I was close to like that.

                <h3>Cassie, UK</h3>
                <p>Cassie was groomed via an online chat room and was consequently blackmailed and and sexually
                    assualted.
                    <br><br>
                    “We got our first computer when I was around 10, when chat rooms were a big thing. You'd get
                    private
                    messages from people you didn't know and have conversations. We never had lessons about online
                    safety —
                    so we didn't know that people might not be who they say they are. <br><br>
                    When I was 13 I started talking to someone who said she was a young woman. She was asking lots
                    of
                    questions and I thought she was trying to make friends. “She” said she was a model and that I
                    could
                    model too. She kept complimenting me, saying I was pretty. She said she did topless modelling
                    and
                    asked
                    me to send a topless picture. I didn't want to but she kept trying to convince me and eventually
                    I
                    sent
                    one.

                <h3>Gibi, US</h3>
                <p>Gibi is a Youtuber who has around 3.8 million subscribers for her ASMR focused YouTube channel.
                    She
                    experienced abuse by people using “deepfakes”, a AI-generated image of someone's likeness.
                    <br><br>
                    “My deepfakes have been around ever since I started my YouTube channel. I've seen how it has
                    gotten
                    very
                    good so that makes me extremely nervous because I know how fast technology can advance. <br><br>
                    When I first saw a deepfake, I was reading about how the computer learns and gets better at
                    matching
                    your face and putting it onto something pornographic. Watching the videos is very surreal —
                    people
                    believe it's real. The thing that bothers me is I did not consent for my image to be used that
                    way,
                    they
                    are able to do it with no consequences and it feels very violating. I contemplated deleting my
                    channel
                    because I felt very overwhelmed.
